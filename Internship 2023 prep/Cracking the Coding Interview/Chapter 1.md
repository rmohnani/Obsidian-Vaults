# Key Points
- Hash table can be implemented using an array of linked lists and a hash code function that takes a key and outputs an int
- Arraylist offers dynamic resizing as needed while giving O(1) access, while array has fixed size and when array is full it doubles in size. Each doubling takes O(n) but becomes less frequent and thus the amortized insertion time is O(1). Inserting N elements is O(N) so on average O(1)
