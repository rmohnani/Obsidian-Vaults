# Chapter: Linked Lists

# Key Points

- Sequence of nodes
- singly linked -> each node points to the next node
- doubly linked -> each node points to its next and previous
- No O(1) time access to any index in list
- To check if element in list is O(n) in size of the list
- Benefit: can add and remove items from beginning of list in constant time
- Linkedlists typically use recursive algorithms. these typcally take at least O(n) space where n is depth of recursive call
