# Chapter:  Stacks and Queues
---
# Key Points
- Stack uses LIFO(last in first out) ordering 
- stack uses pop(), push(x), peek(), isempty()
- Stack doesn't give constan time access to ith element. But is constant for adding and removing items.
- Stack can be implemented using a linked list by adding and removing items from the same side.
- Stacks can be used to implement a recursive algorithm iteratively.
- Queue uses FIFO (first in first out) ordering.
- queue uses add(x), remove(), peek(), isempty()
- Queue can be implemented using a linked list as long as items are added and removed from opposite sides.
- Queus often used in breadth-first search and implementing a cache
