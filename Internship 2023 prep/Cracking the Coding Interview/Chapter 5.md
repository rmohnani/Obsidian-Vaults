# Chapter: Bit Manipulation

# Key Points
- XOR is ^ where it is a 1 if the bits are different
- NOT is ~ where all the bits are flipped
- multiplication by 2^3 is shiffting it left 3 bits
- x ^ 0s = x
- x ^ 1s = ~x
- x ^ x = 0
- x & 0s = 0
- x & 1s = x
- x & x = x
- x | 0s = x
- x | 1s = 1s
- x | x = x
- Computers store integers in 2s complement. Binary representation of -K as a N-bit number is concat(1, 2^(N-1) - K)
- There are two right shifts. Arithm
