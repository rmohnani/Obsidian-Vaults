# Problem Statement
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”
