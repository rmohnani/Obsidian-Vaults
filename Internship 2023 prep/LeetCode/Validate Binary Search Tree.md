# Problem Statement
Given the `root` of a binary tree, _determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)_.

A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

-   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
-   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
-   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
