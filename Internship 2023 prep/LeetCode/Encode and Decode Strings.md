# Problem Statement

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a
string. The encoded string is then sent over the
network and is decoded back to the original list of
strings.

Machine 1 (sender) has the function:
```c
string encode(vector<string> strs) {
1/
... your code
return encoded string;
7
Machine 2 (receiver) has the function:
vector<string> decode (string s) {
//... your code
return strs;
}
```
