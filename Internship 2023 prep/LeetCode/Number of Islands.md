# Problem Statement
Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

# My Solution
after looking at solution was able to do:
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not grid:
            return 0
        
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        islands = 0
        visited = set()

        def bfs(row, col):
            queue = collections.deque()
            queue.append((row, col))
            visited.add((row,col))
            dirs = [(1,0), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

            while queue:
                r,c = queue.popleft()
                for dr,dc in dirs:
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if nr in range(rows) and nc in range(cols) and grid[nr][nc] == "1" and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                        queue.append((nr, nc))
                        visited.add((nr,nc))


        for row in range(rows):
            for col in range(cols):
                if grid[row][col] == "1" and (row, col) not in visited:
                    bfs(row, col)
                    islands += 1
        return islands
```
