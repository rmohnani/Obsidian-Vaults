# Problem Statement
Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.
```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```
