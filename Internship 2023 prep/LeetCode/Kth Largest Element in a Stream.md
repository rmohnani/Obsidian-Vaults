# Problem Statement
Design a class to find the `kth` largest element in a stream. Note that it is the `kth` largest element in the sorted order, not the `kth` distinct element.

Implement `KthLargest` class:

-   `KthLargest(int k, int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer `k` and the stream of integers `nums`.
-   `int add(int val)` Appends the integer `val` to the stream and returns the element representing the `kth` largest element in the stream.
