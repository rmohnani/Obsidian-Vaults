# Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` `grid` where each cell can have one of three values:

-   `0` representing an empty cell,
-   `1` representing a fresh orange, or
-   `2` representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is **4-directionally adjacent** to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return _the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange_. If _this is impossible, return_ `-1`.
