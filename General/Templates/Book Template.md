### Quotes 
Here's some space to write quotes from the book that were impactful to you. Did a character say something really cool? Did the author make a really interesting observation about Swedish Death Cleaning? Write it here!

### Notes 
If you want to take notes while reading the book, here's where you can do that. Protip: you can use dropdowns to condense your notes. That way, you can have a bunch of notes in detail without taking up too much room on the page, and you can always use the search function if you need to find something and don't remember where it's written.

### Review 
If you want to write a review for Goodreads, Amazon, Storygraph, etc., then this is the place to do that. I put it at the end, because I tend to write pretty lengthy reviews so I wanted the shorter information to go up at the top where I can find it more easily without having to scroll past a big block of text.
