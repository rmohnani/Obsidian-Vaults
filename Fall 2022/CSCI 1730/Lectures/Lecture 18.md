In Mapping the Sovereign State, Jordan Branch makes an interesting claim about how the public conceptualizations of the world influenced by maps had a role in the ultimate persistence of the sovereign state model instead of its counterparts. He talks about the change in map making, from depicting collections of centers in the Middle Ages to the eventual homogeneous linearly bounded territories of the sovereign states in the 17th and 18th centuries. This change and peoples increasing reliance on these maps to form their impressions/visualizations of the world meant that political authorities that were not or could not (as in the case of non-territorial authorities) be represented on these, lost their normative basis and eventually decided unacceptable for political foundations. The use of Ptolemy's graticule accorded each place identical importance, and thus the shift in authoritarian claim from centers to homogenous spaces with linear boundaries. I found it especially interesting how treaties usually relied on a textual description of of sub jurisdictions, resources, etc and had to be exhaustively enumerated, until eventually international discussion increasingly adopted the use of such cartographic tools and references.
