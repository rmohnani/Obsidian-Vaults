# 6.2Â Task

In this assignment we will consider four control constructs:

-   generators in Python
    
-   streams in Java 8
    
-   goroutines in Go
    
-   asynchronous functions in JavaScript
    

What are their relative similarities and differences, strengths and weaknesses? As a prompt, imagine someone approaches you saying they need to write a program that would benefit from these kinds of operators, and they have complete flexibility in language choice. How would you guide them to pick one of these? You may use whatever granularity is easiest: whether as one big table, or a sequence of (up to 6) pair-wise comparisons, or some combination thereof.
