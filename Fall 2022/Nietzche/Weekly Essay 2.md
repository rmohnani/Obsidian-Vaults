**What is the psychological mechanism for the revaluation of values that gave birth to "slave morality" according to Scheler? What triggers this mechanism?**

Scheler proposes that when affects such as revenge, hatred, envy are prevented from being discharged they yield psychical repressive forces. These include feelings of impotence, fear, and the deep blockage of 'vital energy' dubbed anguish, due to authoritative powers' continual deprival of the individual's desire. These repressive forces begin by blocking the active expression of the affects followed by removing them from the sphere of conciousness. 

Scheler mentions the tendency to overcome tension between desire and impotence (to acheive it by depreciating the positive value of what was desired, and even extol another thing opposed to the first. The illusory valuation demotivates and weakens the desire. 

This results in falsification of the world view. In order to refute positive values he embraces their negative counterparts to justify his own pattern of value experience, but the world is such that these positive values impose themselves on him regardless of how he may try to avoid them. The tension between desire and impotence remains.

The ineffectiveness of this, yields a perversion or revaluation of the sense of values itself. The values of positive and negative are here flipped, thus *Ressentiment* delivers them from this inner torment. With these new values, the once 'evil' people are no longer enviable or hateful. Here there is no trying to cover up positive values with a negative cloak, instead the process of recollection and experience processing are changed such that concious falsification is no longer required. So belief in these value judgements are true and genuine.

The trigger for this is the detachment of the affects from determinate objects, that instinctively draw the man's attention to events that can set them into motion - that imposes the tension between desire and impotence.
