**What is the psychological mechanism for the revaluation of values that gave birth to "slave morality" according to Scheler? What triggers this mechanism?**

Scheler proposes that when affects such as revenge, hatred, envy are prevented from being discharged they yield psychical repressive forces. These include feelings of impotence, fear, and the deep blockage of 'vital energy' dubbed anguish, due to authoritative powers' continual deprival of the individual's desire. These repressive forces begin by blocking the active expression of the affects followed by removing them from the sphere of conciousness. 

This removal means greater detachment of the impulse from the particular reason or individual and enables it to radiate in all directions, latching on to anything even loosely connected to the original cause of the impulse. Blockage of outward expression, leaves unpleasant visceral internal sensations which when stressed result in self-hatred.
