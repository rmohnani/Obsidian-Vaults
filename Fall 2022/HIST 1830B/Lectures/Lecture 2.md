# Contextualizing Freud
categories of nation and empire clash in 19th century as basic large scale units of political units/organizations as they work against each other. 

Nations have histories. Nation is an imagined community: language, religion, land, etc.
Latin source of nation means birth, in the sense that it is the birth of the individual and the birth of the nation state.
Book - imagined community

Empires are multinantional, multilinguistic, multi religious, geopolitically complex, politically complex with relationships between imperial/hegemonic power at the center and the periphery. Also potentially including colonial body on the outside. 

Partnership between the nation states. State meaning unit of government administration - the exclusive control of legal violence. 
As european political system develops into the 19th cnetury we have consolidation of nation states. 

Sigmund freud born in 1856. Born right into liberal ascendancy. Studies to be a doctor. in 1880s and 1890s the optimisim of that liberal period is cracking. In 1890s the election of antisemmitic mayor fo Vienna. Had a great deal of power. 

Antisemitsims is a political strategy in this case against a people that don't classically fit into the political power dynamic/narrative. A more racial antisemmitism also began. 

"I decide who is a Jew" - mayor of vienna quote

For freud this is the end of plurality of multiculturalism. When it's ratified by the emperor is a terrible day for Freud. And it happens almost to the day he came up with psychoanalysis and interpretations of dreams.

Liberalism meaning open society the ability for everyone to participate in it. Thinks of itself as the inheritance of the long developments associated with the scientific revolution and the enlightenment of the 18th century. Science meaning specialized and d general knowledge.
The freedom of discovery of the universe from the authority of the church, and enlightenment freed certain forms of thought from existing powers.

Liberalism is connected with reason, thinking openly and clearly observation and reason. Meritocracy.
