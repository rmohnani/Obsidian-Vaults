Attack on pyschoanalysis: psychoanalysis is the disease of which it considers itself the cure

Freud the Scientist
Freud the bilogist/medical doctor
Freud bilogist of the mind - tRASH
Freud the thinker of the enlightenment
Freud in Paris works in a public hospital. Has a very diverse population. Freud upset by large numbers of young women who are physically beaten and traumatized. Young women many of them prostitutes. He produces two hypotheses:

first is called hysteria - comes from the ancient word for the womb, is a mental disease comes from trauma associated with women.

First book co authored  called studies on hysteria

The seduction Theory - should be called sexual violence/rape theory. When these women are treated and talked to, they have early childhood trauma involving sexual violence. It is not processed mentally as the victim grows up. Women raped or wounded end up in the hospital and recover a memory of early childhood violence of similar nature. 

The unconcious has to be unavilable because what's in there is too dangerous too violent.

Freud abandons seduction theory. He says some people will suffer these traumas while others wont. He says the seduction theory as a general theory is wrong.
