What single factor (or set of factors) best explains why sovereign territorial states currently constitute the fundamental unit of contemporary international relations? In making your argument, draw from readings from the first six weeks of the course, as well as supplemental material (listed below) that we engaged with collectively in class. The factor (or factors) on which you base your essay could be ones mentioned by authors we read, your own ideas, or some combination thereof. Lay out the logic of your argument and explain why this factor (or set of factors) wields more explanatory power than other possible explanations. Consider specifying what aspects of sovereignty’s emergence and/or endurance are not explained by the factors on which your essay focuses. Consider also what scholars who would disagree with you might say about your argument. Explain why such criticisms, as well as why other possible explanations, would be less persuasive than your viewpoint. Consider what additional evidence, if gathered and analyzed, could more conclusively demonstrate whether or not your argument is valid. Finally, what does your argument imply about the nature of sovereign territorial states, including how international political authority might evolve in the future?

Separate into First world and Third World categories. First world use Spruyt's argument for mutual reinforcement, competitive advantage, punctuated equilibrium, imitation and for Third World use Anghie's point of the Mandate system enforcing a neocolonialism to force their state to model that of Europeans. Maybe briefly talk about China and Japan and how they're more unique than this. 

## The Sovereign State and its Competitors - Spruyt

- Spruyt claims the unilinear view of history is wrong and instead approaches the cause for soveriegn states being the dominant model through a punctated equilibrium lense like that of darwinism
	- He talks about how the generative cause for alternative models is different from the reason that sovereign state model is what survived as the dominant one
		- “Critical to my analysis is the separation of the generative causes of such new institutional arrangements from the causes that led to the demise of some.”
	- “That is, changes in political organization seem to be preceded by broad shifts in constraints and opportunities imposed on social actors by the external milieu.”
	- “Transaction costs, set belief systems, and standard operating procedures mitigate against frequent overhaul.”
	- “Once one form has established itself as dominant, relative stability in institutional types should follow.17 There is a certain path dependency in institutional design.”
	- “Actors have particular interests and perspectives and corresponding preferred forms of organization. An external change, a change in the overall milieu in which that society is placed, will lead to a shift in the relative power of social and political actors. Individuals will seek to capitalize on their improved relative position and change the existing political institutions. I thus take a methodological individualist perspective. Individuals have reasoned preferences to support one institution over another. The emergence of new institutions must thus be traced back to the ability of actors to pursue those preferences.”
- Spruty argues that the exogenous variable that was the generative cause for different forms of political and social alignments in city-leagues, etc was rise of trade and economic growth
	- “I argue that all three were affected by the rise of trade, my independent variable. During the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, Europe went through a remarkable period of economic growth. This exogenous variable set a process of realignments in motion.”

- Spruyt's main arguments for the superiority of the soveriegn state model
	- “I will argue that selection occurs both by systemic pressure on the less competitive types and by societal choices of actors who switch their allegiances. Systemically, from a top-down perspective, there are three main reasons why states survived and displaced other forms of organization. First, the internal logic of organization of the sovereign state had less deficiencies than its rivals. Sovereign, territorial states were better at rationalizing their economies and mobilizing the resources of their societies.33 Second, state sovereignty proved to be an effective and efficient means of organizing external, interunit behavior. Sovereign states could more easily make credible commitments than their nonsovereign counterparts. Third, sovereign states selected out and delegitimized actors who did not fit a system of territorially demarcated and internally hierarchical authorities. The organizational principles of territorial states and city-leagues were mutually incompatible, exactly because the latter had no specific borders.”
	- “Selection, however, also occurs by social choice, from the bottom up. Since sovereignty is an institutional mechanism which creates a focal point for coordinating behavior, members of sovereign societies can achieve gains from long-run, iterative cooperation. If the benefits of long-term cooperation outweigh the benefits of short-run defection, social actors have an incentive to defect from institutions that do not provide for these benefits”
	- “Institutional mimicry constitutes a second form of social choice.30 For example, once the benefits of sovereign statehood became apparent, the German feudal lords started to behave like territorial rulers. They started to call themselves princes and to perform regalian tasks such as regulating weights and measures, standardizing coinage, and rationalizing justice.”
	- “Tilly argues that the creation of new types of units in Europe basically proceeded along two dimensions. The first dimension was coercive intensive and the second was capital intensive. “In the coercion intensive mode, rulers squeezed the means of war from their own populations and others they conquered, building massive structures of extraction in the process.”38 This method of resource mobilization occurred in regions that lacked strongly developed towns, such as Brandenburg and Russia. Areas that had well-developed towns, such as Italy and the Netherlands, had to make bargains with capitalists—the capital-intensive mode of resource mobilization.
	- National states such as England and France combined both coercive- and capital-intensive modes. “In the intermediate capitalized-coercion mode, rulers did some of each, but spent more of their effort than did their capital-intensive neighbors on incorporating capitalists and sources of capital directly into the structures of their states.”39”
	- “Gradually, competitive pressure selected out those organizations that used only one of the two methods of resource mobilization. The national state, which utilized both of these methods, proved to be better at waging war.40”
	- “First, Tilly explains the variation between types of organization by differential responses to the functional demand of waging war.”
	- “My account is based on the impact of economic change and subsequent politics of coalitional bargaining. I see the economic transformation of medieval Europe as the primary independent variable which made new political coalitions possible"
	- “Tilly explains selection among rival modes of organization by their ability to wage war. From my perspective, the ability to wage war is itself determined by the efficacy of particular institutional arrangements.”
	- “Tilly explains the variation in unit type by different responses to the functional necessity of waging war. These different responses can in turn be explained by regional variation in the strength of towns. I argue, by contrast, that variation can be explained by different responses to a changing economic environment”
	- “Tilly, selection is rooted in the unit’s security performance. From my perspective, the critical variable is institutional structure”
	- “Whether or not a particular type of organization will survive depends on its ability to prevent freeriding, its credibility to commit in international treaties, compatibility with other types of organization, and the benefits that it provides to its subjects (in order to prevent defection).”
