What single factor (or set of factors) best explains why sovereign territorial states currently constitute the fundamental unit of contemporary international relations? In making your argument, draw from readings from the first six weeks of the course, as well as supplemental material (listed below) that we engaged with collectively in class. The factor (or factors) on which you base your essay could be ones mentioned by authors we read, your own ideas, or some combination thereof. Lay out the logic of your argument and explain why this factor (or set of factors) wields more explanatory power than other possible explanations. Consider specifying what aspects of sovereignty’s emergence and/or endurance are not explained by the factors on which your essay focuses. Consider also what scholars who would disagree with you might say about your argument. Explain why such criticisms, as well as why other possible explanations, would be less persuasive than your viewpoint. Consider what additional evidence, if gathered and analyzed, could more conclusively demonstrate whether or not your argument is valid. Finally, what does your argument imply about the nature of sovereign territorial states, including how international political authority might evolve in the future?

Separate into First world and Third World categories. First world use Spruyt's argument for mutual reinforcement, competitive advantage, punctuated equilibrium, imitation and for Third World use Anghie's point of the Mandate system enforcing a neocolonialism to force their state to model that of Europeans. Maybe briefly talk about China and Japan and how they're more unique than this. 

# The Sovereign State and its Competitors - Spruyt

- Spruyt claims the unilinear view of history is wrong and instead approaches the cause for soveriegn states being the dominant model through a punctated equilibrium lense like that of darwinism
	- He talks about how the generative cause for alternative models is different from the reason that sovereign state model is what survived as the dominant one
		- “Critical to my analysis is the separation of the generative causes of such new institutional arrangements from the causes that led to the demise of some.”
	- “That is, changes in political organization seem to be preceded by broad shifts in constraints and opportunities imposed on social actors by the external milieu.”
	- “Transaction costs, set belief systems, and standard operating procedures mitigate against frequent overhaul.”
	- “Once one form has established itself as dominant, relative stability in institutional types should follow.17 There is a certain path dependency in institutional design.”
	- “Actors have particular interests and perspectives and corresponding preferred forms of organization. An external change, a change in the overall milieu in which that society is placed, will lead to a shift in the relative power of social and political actors. Individuals will seek to capitalize on their improved relative position and change the existing political institutions. I thus take a methodological individualist perspective. Individuals have reasoned preferences to support one institution over another. The emergence of new institutions must thus be traced back to the ability of actors to pursue those preferences.”
- Spruty argues that the exogenous variable that was the generative cause for different forms of political and social alignments in city-leagues, etc was rise of trade and economic growth
	- “I argue that all three were affected by the rise of trade, my independent variable. During the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, Europe went through a remarkable period of economic growth. This exogenous variable set a process of realignments in motion.”
	- 
- Spruyt's main arguments for the superiority of the soveriegn state model
	- “I will argue that selection occurs both by systemic pressure on the less competitive types and by societal choices of actors who switch their allegiances. Systemically, from a top-down perspective, there are three main reasons why states survived and displaced other forms of organization. First, the internal logic of organization of the sovereign state had less deficiencies than its rivals. Sovereign, territorial states were better at rationalizing their economies and mobilizing the resources of their societies.33 Second, state sovereignty proved to be an effective and efficient means of organizing external, interunit behavior. Sovereign states could more easily make credible commitments than their nonsovereign counterparts. Third, sovereign states selected out and delegitimized actors who did not fit a system of territorially demarcated and internally hierarchical authorities. The organizational principles of territorial states and city-leagues were mutually incompatible, exactly because the latter had no specific borders.”
	- “Selection, however, also occurs by social choice, from the bottom up. Since sovereignty is an institutional mechanism which creates a focal point for coordinating behavior, members of sovereign societies can achieve gains from long-run, iterative cooperation. If the benefits of long-term cooperation outweigh the benefits of short-run defection, social actors have an incentive to defect from institutions that do not provide for these benefits”
	- “Institutional mimicry constitutes a second form of social choice.30 For example, once the benefits of sovereign statehood became apparent, the German feudal lords started to behave like territorial rulers. They started to call themselves princes and to perform regalian tasks such as regulating weights and measures, standardizing coinage, and rationalizing justice.”
	- “Tilly argues that the creation of new types of units in Europe basically proceeded along two dimensions. The first dimension was coercive intensive and the second was capital intensive. “In the coercion intensive mode, rulers squeezed the means of war from their own populations and others they conquered, building massive structures of extraction in the process.”38 This method of resource mobilization occurred in regions that lacked strongly developed towns, such as Brandenburg and Russia. Areas that had well-developed towns, such as Italy and the Netherlands, had to make bargains with capitalists—the capital-intensive mode of resource mobilization.
	- National states such as England and France combined both coercive- and capital-intensive modes. “In the intermediate capitalized-coercion mode, rulers did some of each, but spent more of their effort than did their capital-intensive neighbors on incorporating capitalists and sources of capital directly into the structures of their states.”39”
	- “Gradually, competitive pressure selected out those organizations that used only one of the two methods of resource mobilization. The national state, which utilized both of these methods, proved to be better at waging war.40”
	- “First, Tilly explains the variation between types of organization by differential responses to the functional demand of waging war.”
	- “My account is based on the impact of economic change and subsequent politics of coalitional bargaining. I see the economic transformation of medieval Europe as the primary independent variable which made new political coalitions possible"
	- “Tilly explains selection among rival modes of organization by their ability to wage war. From my perspective, the ability to wage war is itself determined by the efficacy of particular institutional arrangements.”
	- “Tilly explains the variation in unit type by different responses to the functional necessity of waging war. These different responses can in turn be explained by regional variation in the strength of towns. I argue, by contrast, that variation can be explained by different responses to a changing economic environment”
	- “Tilly, selection is rooted in the unit’s security performance. From my perspective, the critical variable is institutional structure”
	- “Whether or not a particular type of organization will survive depends on its ability to prevent freeriding, its credibility to commit in international treaties, compatibility with other types of organization, and the benefits that it provides to its subjects (in order to prevent defection).”
- “The national state centralized and accumulated more coercive means than its rivals.45 The physical size of the state makes the difference. ”
- “If, as Tilly proposes, war making is the crucial selecting mechanism, then it is difficult to explain why so many small states survived. Why, for example, were the minuscule German states recognized as treaty signees equal to France or England, even in the middle of the nineteenth century? ”
- “it is the empowerment by other states of such entities that allows them to continue to operate in world affairs rather than their ability to wield force.”
- “In summary, I basically disagree with Tilly on two dimensions. First, I explain institutional variation by the specific nature of social coalitions following economic change rather than by different responses to the functional prerequisite of war making. Second, I argue that whereas war is an important factor, the ability to wage war itself needs to be explained by institutional analysis. I would argue that on these dimensions, however, my theory complements Tilly’s analysis by specifying the particular bargains underlying the state-making process.”

## Chapter 3

- “modern state is verily unique, for it claims sovereignty and territoriality. It is sovereign in that it claims final authority and recognizes no higher source of jurisdiction. It is territorial in that rule is defined as exclusive authority over a fixed territorial space.”
- “contemporary state is not only territorial but is internally sovereign. That is, it is externally demarcated from others. It makes no claim to rule outside its borders and, conversely, recognizes no authority above it within them. Internally it claims final authority. In Weber’s terms, it claims the monopoly of violence or, put in more general political terms, it is the final locus of jurisdiction.”
- “I argue that feudalism is a highly decentralized system of political organization which is based on personal ties.”
- “There are three main differences between the logic of feudal organization and organization based on sovereign territoriality. First, feudal rule lacked hierarchy. Second, territorial rule was not exclusive. Third, feudal rule of territory was imperfect. Manorial relations in some ways resembled territorial rule the closest. One would be subject to the jurisdiction of a lord by one’s residence in a given area. However, seen as a system of larger political rule, the territorial holdings of the lords were dependent on the specific personal relations in which they were embedded. Feudal relations superseded the manorial.”
- “Consequently, one can question whether the feudal logic of organization is even properly conceived as a system of territorial rule”
- “In summary, the feudal logic of rule differed from sovereign territoriality in that it lacked territorial delimitation52 and lacked a final locus of jurisdiction. It was a system based on personal ties conferring rights and obligations across territories. These ties were reaffirmed by the construction of nobility as a caste, a special legal class which demarcated itself by cultural markers such as dress, manners, and rituals and which claimed superiority simply as a birthright.”
- “The revolutionary impact of the Investiture Conflict was therefore twofold.92 First, in separating the two realms, it necessitated secular rule to justify itself by other than spiritual means. Second, in distinguishing and separating these two realms, which both had claims to universality, the two became rivals. Which one was to be subject to the other? As a result, both camps had to seek political allies, search for new sources of legitimation, and rationalize their administrative and legal machineries. The Investiture Conflict in a sense necessitated rulers to invent “secular” rule.”
- “Traditional empires have usually had a universalist system of rule. They have basically aspired to exercise political control over their relevant sphere of economic interaction.”“Universal empires tended to claim some form of cosmological justification.”
