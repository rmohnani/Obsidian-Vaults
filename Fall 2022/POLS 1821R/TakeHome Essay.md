What single factor (or set of factors) best explains why sovereign territorial states currently constitute the fundamental unit of contemporary international relations? In making your argument, draw from readings from the first six weeks of the course, as well as supplemental material (listed below) that we engaged with collectively in class. The factor (or factors) on which you base your essay could be ones mentioned by authors we read, your own ideas, or some combination thereof. Lay out the logic of your argument and explain why this factor (or set of factors) wields more explanatory power than other possible explanations. Consider specifying what aspects of sovereignty’s emergence and/or endurance are not explained by the factors on which your essay focuses. Consider also what scholars who would disagree with you might say about your argument. Explain why such criticisms, as well as why other possible explanations, would be less persuasive than your viewpoint. Consider what additional evidence, if gathered and analyzed, could more conclusively demonstrate whether or not your argument is valid. Finally, what does your argument imply about the nature of sovereign territorial states, including how international political authority might evolve in the future?

Separate into First world and Third World categories. First world use Spruyt's argument for mutual reinforcement, competitive advantage, punctuated equilibrium, imitation and for Third World use Anghie's point of the Mandate system enforcing a neocolonialism to force their state to model that of Europeans. Maybe briefly talk about China and Japan and how they're more unique than this. 

# The Sovereign State and its Competitors - Spruyt

- Spruyt claims the unilinear view of history is wrong and instead approaches the cause for soveriegn states being the dominant model through a punctated equilibrium lense like that of darwinism
	- He talks about how the generative cause for alternative models is different from the reason that sovereign state model is what survived as the dominant one
		- “Critical to my analysis is the separation of the generative causes of such new institutional arrangements from the causes that led to the demise of some.”
	- “That is, changes in political organization seem to be preceded by broad shifts in constraints and opportunities imposed on social actors by the external milieu.”
	- “Transaction costs, set belief systems, and standard operating procedures mitigate against frequent overhaul.”
	- “Once one form has established itself as dominant, relative stability in institutional types should follow.17 There is a certain path dependency in institutional design.”
	- “Actors have particular interests and perspectives and corresponding preferred forms of organization. An external change, a change in the overall milieu in which that society is placed, will lead to a shift in the relative power of social and political actors. Individuals will seek to capitalize on their improved relative position and change the existing political institutions. I thus take a methodological individualist perspective. Individuals have reasoned preferences to support one institution over another. The emergence of new institutions must thus be traced back to the ability of actors to pursue those preferences.”
- Spruty argues that the exogenous variable that was the generative cause for different forms of political and social alignments in city-leagues, etc was rise of trade and economic growth
	- “I argue that all three were affected by the rise of trade, my independent variable. During the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, Europe went through a remarkable period of economic growth. This exogenous variable set a process of realignments in motion.”
	- 
- Spruyt's main arguments for the superiority of the soveriegn state model
	- “I will argue that selection occurs both by systemic pressure on the less competitive types and by societal choices of actors who switch their allegiances. Systemically, from a top-down perspective, there are three main reasons why states survived and displaced other forms of organization. First, the internal logic of organization of the sovereign state had less deficiencies than its rivals. Sovereign, territorial states were better at rationalizing their economies and mobilizing the resources of their societies.33 Second, state sovereignty proved to be an effective and efficient means of organizing external, interunit behavior. Sovereign states could more easily make credible commitments than their nonsovereign counterparts. Third, sovereign states selected out and delegitimized actors who did not fit a system of territorially demarcated and internally hierarchical authorities. The organizational principles of territorial states and city-leagues were mutually incompatible, exactly because the latter had no specific borders.”
	- “Selection, however, also occurs by social choice, from the bottom up. Since sovereignty is an institutional mechanism which creates a focal point for coordinating behavior, members of sovereign societies can achieve gains from long-run, iterative cooperation. If the benefits of long-term cooperation outweigh the benefits of short-run defection, social actors have an incentive to defect from institutions that do not provide for these benefits”
	- “Institutional mimicry constitutes a second form of social choice.30 For example, once the benefits of sovereign statehood became apparent, the German feudal lords started to behave like territorial rulers. They started to call themselves princes and to perform regalian tasks such as regulating weights and measures, standardizing coinage, and rationalizing justice.”
	- “Tilly argues that the creation of new types of units in Europe basically proceeded along two dimensions. The first dimension was coercive intensive and the second was capital intensive. “In the coercion intensive mode, rulers squeezed the means of war from their own populations and others they conquered, building massive structures of extraction in the process.”38 This method of resource mobilization occurred in regions that lacked strongly developed towns, such as Brandenburg and Russia. Areas that had well-developed towns, such as Italy and the Netherlands, had to make bargains with capitalists—the capital-intensive mode of resource mobilization.
	- National states such as England and France combined both coercive- and capital-intensive modes. “In the intermediate capitalized-coercion mode, rulers did some of each, but spent more of their effort than did their capital-intensive neighbors on incorporating capitalists and sources of capital directly into the structures of their states.”39”
	- “Gradually, competitive pressure selected out those organizations that used only one of the two methods of resource mobilization. The national state, which utilized both of these methods, proved to be better at waging war.40”
	- “First, Tilly explains the variation between types of organization by differential responses to the functional demand of waging war.”
	- “My account is based on the impact of economic change and subsequent politics of coalitional bargaining. I see the economic transformation of medieval Europe as the primary independent variable which made new political coalitions possible"
	- “Tilly explains selection among rival modes of organization by their ability to wage war. From my perspective, the ability to wage war is itself determined by the efficacy of particular institutional arrangements.”
	- “Tilly explains the variation in unit type by different responses to the functional necessity of waging war. These different responses can in turn be explained by regional variation in the strength of towns. I argue, by contrast, that variation can be explained by different responses to a changing economic environment”
	- “Tilly, selection is rooted in the unit’s security performance. From my perspective, the critical variable is institutional structure”
	- “Whether or not a particular type of organization will survive depends on its ability to prevent freeriding, its credibility to commit in international treaties, compatibility with other types of organization, and the benefits that it provides to its subjects (in order to prevent defection).”
- “The national state centralized and accumulated more coercive means than its rivals.45 The physical size of the state makes the difference. ”
- “If, as Tilly proposes, war making is the crucial selecting mechanism, then it is difficult to explain why so many small states survived. Why, for example, were the minuscule German states recognized as treaty signees equal to France or England, even in the middle of the nineteenth century? ”
- “it is the empowerment by other states of such entities that allows them to continue to operate in world affairs rather than their ability to wield force.”
- “In summary, I basically disagree with Tilly on two dimensions. First, I explain institutional variation by the specific nature of social coalitions following economic change rather than by different responses to the functional prerequisite of war making. Second, I argue that whereas war is an important factor, the ability to wage war itself needs to be explained by institutional analysis. I would argue that on these dimensions, however, my theory complements Tilly’s analysis by specifying the particular bargains underlying the state-making process.”

## Chapter 3

- “modern state is verily unique, for it claims sovereignty and territoriality. It is sovereign in that it claims final authority and recognizes no higher source of jurisdiction. It is territorial in that rule is defined as exclusive authority over a fixed territorial space.”
- “contemporary state is not only territorial but is internally sovereign. That is, it is externally demarcated from others. It makes no claim to rule outside its borders and, conversely, recognizes no authority above it within them. Internally it claims final authority. In Weber’s terms, it claims the monopoly of violence or, put in more general political terms, it is the final locus of jurisdiction.”
- “I argue that feudalism is a highly decentralized system of political organization which is based on personal ties.”
- “There are three main differences between the logic of feudal organization and organization based on sovereign territoriality. First, feudal rule lacked hierarchy. Second, territorial rule was not exclusive. Third, feudal rule of territory was imperfect. Manorial relations in some ways resembled territorial rule the closest. One would be subject to the jurisdiction of a lord by one’s residence in a given area. However, seen as a system of larger political rule, the territorial holdings of the lords were dependent on the specific personal relations in which they were embedded. Feudal relations superseded the manorial.”
- “Consequently, one can question whether the feudal logic of organization is even properly conceived as a system of territorial rule”
- “In summary, the feudal logic of rule differed from sovereign territoriality in that it lacked territorial delimitation52 and lacked a final locus of jurisdiction. It was a system based on personal ties conferring rights and obligations across territories. These ties were reaffirmed by the construction of nobility as a caste, a special legal class which demarcated itself by cultural markers such as dress, manners, and rituals and which claimed superiority simply as a birthright.”
- “The revolutionary impact of the Investiture Conflict was therefore twofold.92 First, in separating the two realms, it necessitated secular rule to justify itself by other than spiritual means. Second, in distinguishing and separating these two realms, which both had claims to universality, the two became rivals. Which one was to be subject to the other? As a result, both camps had to seek political allies, search for new sources of legitimation, and rationalize their administrative and legal machineries. The Investiture Conflict in a sense necessitated rulers to invent “secular” rule.”
- “Traditional empires have usually had a universalist system of rule. They have basically aspired to exercise political control over their relevant sphere of economic interaction.”“Universal empires tended to claim some form of cosmological justification.”“mperial strategy failed, first because it could only reach a compromise with the papacy at considerable expense. The compromise, concluded in the Concordat of Worms, conferred to the emperor the right of approval, but he could no longer appoint the bishop with sacerdotal insignia, the staff and ring.114 This was more than mere symbolism and meant that the emperor did not have jurisdiction over bishops in the emperor’s capacity as member of the clergy. ”
- “The struggles of this period can be described as “a three cornered conflict between a secularized episcopate (anxious to preserve its customary prerogatives against papal centralization), the imperial power (which saw papal centralization as a menace to its own monarchical authority) and the Papacy (which saw centralization as the only way to a reformed and purified Church).”

## Part 2: The Emergence of New Modes of Organization

### Chapter 4 - Economic Rennaisance of the late middle ages

- “Sovereignty is not a fact. It is a concept which men in certain circumstances have applied—a quality they have attributed or a claim they have counter-posed—to the political power which they or other men were exercising.”
- “result of this economic dynamism was that a social group, the town dwellers, came into existence with new sources of revenue and power, which did not fit the old feudal order. This new social group, the burghers, had various incentives to search for political allies who were willing to change the existing order. Neither the burghers’ material preferences nor their belief systems fit the existing institutional and conceptual frameworks. “The new trading and commercial classes of the towns could not settle into the straightjacket of the feudal order, and the towns became a chief agent in its final disruption”
- “Generative Phase
		Independent variable:
			Economic growth and expansion of trade (1000-1350).
		Intervening variable:
			New coalitions become possible because of shifts in relative power caused by economic expansion. Towns emerge that do not fit the old feudal order. They seek to create new institutions by allying with political entrepreneurs.
		Outcome:
			A variety of new institutions—sovereign, territorial state; city-state; and city-league.
	Selective Phase
		Causes of selection:
			Competition Mutual empowerment Mimicry and exit
		Outcome:
			Sovereign, territorial state.”
- “Given that towns had to contend with political opponents who wished to subject cities for their own benefit, for example, to gain revenue, towns would have to band together or seek territorial lords who were less predatorial than others. Hence, towns required either city-leagues to pool their resources or high territorial lords who were willing to mitigate their exactions from rival lords.”
- “French towns:
	low volume low added value
	Corresponding level of urbanization relatively low, with the exception of Flanders and northern France. Towns prefer central organization to provide protection and improve economic climate (standardization, reduction of transaction costs, etc.).
	
	German towns:
	high volume low added value
	Moderate level of urbanization. Towns need a central actor or league to pool their resources for defense and to improve economic environment (standardization, reduction of transaction costs, etc.).
	
	Italian towns:
	moderate volume high added value
	High level of urbanization. Large towns with considerable resources do not need central actor for protection. Predatorial market suggests competition rather than collusion. Competition for market shares with high payoffs.”
- “
	Expected preferences of towns
	Actual political coalitions
	Outcome
	
	France:
	central actor
	Weak kings ally with towns. Bargain based on shared material interests regarding tax structure and royal administration as well as shared perspectives on preferred social order. Aristocracy and clergy paid off by pension schemes and tax exemptions.
	sovereign, territorial state
	
	Germany:
	central actor
	German king (Holy Roman Emperor) pursues imperial strategy in Italy and surrenders control over the German towns to the feudal lords. After failure in Italy, the king becomes a figurehead. Towns form leagues against the lords.
	city-leagues and independent lordships
	
	Italy:
	urban independence
	Urbanized aristocracy Unlike Germany or France, no clash between towns and lords. Bourgeois and nobles resist central control by German emperor or pope.
	city-states”
- “emergence of sovereign, territorial rule was, therefore, not merely a fight between the forces favoring fragmentation versus centralization; it was a contest about the very nature of authority and kingship.”
- “But although this shift in beliefs and values was important, it alone cannot explain the decline of the medieval order. Much of Europe was exposed to similar new ideas and values, yet political outcomes differed. For example, although the emergence of a monetarized economy and pursuit of profit brought with it a revaluation of manual labor and economic gain, this was true throughout much of western Europe. Moreover, Germany, France, and Italy all had access to Roman law, and consequently all their social and political elites were familiar with the idea of sovereignty. Yet institutional outcomes differed quite radically in all three. Changes in belief systems alone cannot explain the institutional variation”
- “Elective affinity is a predisposition to certain ideas, not the instrumental construction of values or ideas solely to serve one’s material interests.”
- “whether such ideas become routinized will depend on their material support. The carriers of such ideas will often depend on economic power or coercive means to spread and develop these ideas. Social groups will look for political allies who can advance their preferred order. Conversely, political elites have an incentive to propagate and foster new ideas to gain support from social groups. They manipulate cultural symbols for their own instrumental reasons.38 It is thus the correspondence of interests and ideas that brings actors together in a coalition and thereby empowers new sets of ideas in political practice”
- “The instruments that the church used to rationalize its proceedings were later appropriated by aspiring territorial rulers and modernizing elements in late medieval society.
	First, the church had led the way in diminishing the role of kinship structures. It particularly had propagated the idea of primogeniture, because consolidated holdings would increase ecclesiastical revenue through wills.59 It thus broke up older tribal and kin relations and made it impossible later to organize market exchange along those lines.60
	Second, the church had tried to diminish the level of ubiquitous violence by outlawing war on particular days and regulating certain modes of combat. In proclaiming the Peace and Truce of God, the church thus appropriated the role of a public actor.61 One function of this authority was to maintain the general peace. In so doing the church created the idea that one of the roles of government was to provide for the collective good.
	Third, in arguing for a hierarchy of feudal rule rather than a grab bag of cross-cutting and multiple obligations, the church moved against fragmentation of political order. That is, it argued for a feudal pyramid. In Strayer’s words, feudal rule in the twelfth century…”
- “the contest between church and empire eroded the basis of both sources of authority. It delegitimized both papacy and empire. Popes had to contend with antipopes, the emperor faced rivals supported by lords and pope, and some bishoprics had two bishops. Pope and emperor branded each other as false monks, usurpers, and heretics. In addition to delegitimizing each other, the contest also made secular rulers aware that ecclesiastical support was a dangerous basis for political rule. Ultimately, ecclesiastical lords would have to answer to Rome. In a sense the denial of sacral status to political rule necessitated that secular rulers find alternative justifications”
- “other words, the demarcation and conceptualization of time and space are essentially contested concepts. “Against the merchant’s time, the church set up its own time.”69 The traditional medieval conceptualization of spatial and chronological order did not correspond to the new beliefs of society.70 The burghers had very different views about time and space. Time and space did not exist informs homologous to heaven; they did not exist transcendentally but were constructed and designed by mortals. Such new images made the later articulation of authority in and over geographical space possible.”
- “About the middle of the eleventh century a dramatic expansion of the European economy occurred. This expansion went hand-in-hand with an increase in long-distance trade. The growth in trade made further division of labor possible. Towns increased in size and number. These settlements had widely different material interests from the old feudal and ecclesiastical order. Consequently the burghers were motivated to change existing institutions. To accomplish this, they either formed political alliances with other actors, such as an aspiring territorial ruler, or they pursued the largest amount of independence possible. Whether these towns pursued autonomy on their own, formed leagues, or allied with some centralizing authority depended first of all on the size and strength of the individual towns. Few towns, save the Italian, were strong enough to go it alone. The second factor influencing the urban set of preferences was the nature of trade. The relatively low-volume, high-profit trade of the Mediterranean, the trade in luxury goods, suggested that individual towns might try to capture a monopoly position on their own. By contrast, the low-profit, high-volume trade of the north made that policy impossible. No one actor could individually monopolize the[…]”
