How do we draw borders in 1s and 0s - How do we incorporate the information age into a more robust sovereignty? This paper will explore why the internet and more particularly cyberspace must mark a shift in the perception of sovereignty, and what a plausible change would be. It would then go on to explore the laws and regulations that it would spawn or that would require this change in sovereignty. It will also tackle the increasingly important role of large technological corporations such as Google, Meta, etc and how they must fit into our new definition of sovereignty.
