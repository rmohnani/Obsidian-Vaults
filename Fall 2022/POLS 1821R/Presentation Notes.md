- Using example of Nauru for phosphate mining exploitation, begins argument by saying that international law has legitimized colonial exploitation and made it difficult to argue any claims for colonial reparations.
- 'Third World Sovereignty' was limited and had disadvantages compared to the west, it was made uniquely vulnerable and dependent by intl law.
- colonialism central to international law and infact sovereignty emerged out of colonial encounters. Out of the need to create a legal syste to account for european to non-european relations in confrontation.
- He looks at the civilizing mission - grand project which justified colonialism as a meands of redeeming the backward, aberrant, violent, oppressed, undeveloped people of non-european worlds by incroporating them into the european civilization system.
- 'dynamic of difference' denotes the process of demarcating one culture as universal and civilized and another as particular and uncivilized and thus bridging this gap involves 'normalizing' the aberrant society
- some international lawyers argue that Intl law came to colonies fully formed and ready for use.
-  SIDE NOTE: Intl Law not law cuz it doesnt originate from a single global sovereign
- axiomatic framework in which European states are sovereign and everyone else is not, the history of the world involves the incorporation of Africa, Asia, etc, into an International Law that is explicitly european but somehow Universal.
- incorporation he argues is debilitating and excluding rather than empowering and liberating
- "Cultural difference" is what forces us to tackle the order among states.
- What does it mean that international law governs states when certain states were denied sovereign status?
- Many third world jurists attempted to show some fundamental principles of international law like treaties and equity were found in african and eastern statecraft - not unique to the west. -> used to imply certain principles regarding the character and exercise of authority
- classical intl law denounced as product of imperialism 

# Chapter 3

- By the conclusion of the 19th century the european system of international law encompassed the entire globe
- Mandata system of the league of nations was an international regime created for the purpose of foverning the territories from Middle east to africa to pacific that had been annexxed by germany or the ottoman empire. Instead of treating them as spoils of war the Intl community resolved to place them under international tutelage. 
- The mandate system sought to ensure the proection of these territories and promote self-government and intergations into the Intl system as sovereign nation states.
- Dynamic of difference was constructed by the jurisprudence of the league. Distinction of non-european sovereignty is caused by the international systems and institutions not despite it. 

## Intro
- MS originally devised to provide internationally supervised protection for people of the above areas.
- Woodrow Wilson - then Prez of the USA - argued for the use of the MS on the territories above rather than terrirories left behind by collapse of european empires. He thought the annexation of these territories by victorious powers would be contrary to principles of freedom and democracy.
- Goal of MS was to protect interests of the people and guide them towards self-government and independence
- MS embodied two broad sets of obligations. 1. to protect the natives ad advance their welfare. 2. procedural obligations relating to the system of supervision designed to ensure the mandatory power was properly administrating the area.
- Prevent exploitation of the natives and promote well being and development
- Dominion powers south africa, australia and new zealand were intent on annexation and unwilling to accept independence
- Mandate territories were classified accoridng to their degree of advancement in three tiers A,B, C, with C being given extensive powers for administration
- To acheive effective supervision, mandatories were obliged to submit and annual report to the league council. Submitted to the Permanent Mandates Commission (PMC), monitoring organ established to adise council on all matters relating to the observnce of the mandates
- Conflict between mandatory and lage member to be sent to the Permananet Court of International Justice.

## League of Nations and new intl law
- It was through the creation of the international institution the league of nations that attempted to address the problem of war of peace, etc.
- League attempted to replicate institutions found at the domestic level like legislature, judiciary, and executive. But it lacked power to bind its member states.
- League attempted to establish a notion that aggresion against any member state was an aggression against all member states of the league, a system of collective security. But ti could not bind sovereignty
- the more international economic interests grow the more international law will grow
- International law required a legal phil that took into account social psych, econ and socio and that it was embedde in society and furthered social objectives rather than be a 'science'
- Formation of the leage questione dthe formalist system f positivist international law based on an absolute sovereign.
- The emergence of the UN system of intl human rights law that enabled intl law and institutions to regulate relations between a sovereign and its citizens. Thus the goal of the MS was to create the sovereign not to qualify its rights.
- the progress of international law is intimately connected with the victory everywhere of constitutional government over autocratic government or of democracy over autocracy.
- The interior of the state remained outside of the scrutiny of IL, because only when it manifested in external actions could it become an international issue.
- the intl human rights law enabled entry into this interior to address and administer civilizing therapy to the body politic of the sovereign state
- Under the MS intl law and institutions were required to create the economic political and social conditions under which a sovereign state could ocme into being.

## Colonial Problems
- Wilson asserted that each distinctive culture was entittled to being an independent state (self-determination). He condemned colonialism,
- Imperial powers grew more acutely aware of the economic importance of colonies as they demanded more self-government and increased political freedom
- The importance of colonies resources and labour were highlighted during the first world war where they sent soldiers to the western front and raw materials like cotton, tin, etc. They would be even more valuable in the future if their economic potentials were realized.
- 'open door policy' one of wilsons 14 points in which it would ensure all states could trade and invest on equal footing without fear for discrimination in mandate territories, which was added to B class mandates, but wilson also wanted it for A class mandates.
- colonial people were strviing for independence at a time where their economic value and significance for metroplois was increasingly evident, which the MS had to balance.

## Government, sovereignty, economy
- preoccupation with economic development dominated all other aspecs of social policy most significantly the haracter of the government created. (economization of sovereignty)
- Hall argues that a properly administrated mandate territory was virtually the same as a properly administered colony, because the PMC inevitabl followed the 'enlightened' colonial policy as no other alternative existed.
- dual mandate involved protecting the welfare of the natives by transmitting to them the benefits of civilization while expanding trade and international commerce in the colonized territories.
- beloning of resources to the larger 'international community. Terms of exploitation were set by the colonial powers inevitably led to the sacrifice of native interests.
- the outright exploitation of native peoples by chartered companies that took place in the 19th century was condemned, the new regime of unequal exchange offically sanctioned by colonial state and embodied in legal regulations was completely acceptable.
- Economic progress, the determining standard, was not to be associated with a particular race or culture - it was a universal category. It would serve as a neutral test that would objectively decide which traits of native cultures would survive if at all.
- with respect to trade colonialism was seen as both inefficient economically and destabilizing politically because it inhibited free trade.
- united states and open door policy to maintain their own economic interests, league's failure to reach and agreement was decisive in the final refusal of the us to be party to the league
- new set of moral principles liberalism and humanity. The goal was to increase native productivity, and so the PMC monitored labour policies and output was able to to develop more effective standards because they were empirically based.
- initiatives focusing on native labour connected very intimately tge physical existence of the native with labour that the league now had a means of civilizing and disciplining him. native was linked to the larger intl economic system and connected him with economy, progress, and capitalism.
- exemplification of humanist and liberal principles is the new form of colonialism based on preserving and developing the native and her territories as productive assets rather than exploiting and exhausting them.
- League council permitted compulsory or forced labour for remuneration for 'essential public work and services' because infrastructure projects were of such central importance. The enormous toll this had on native population was bad enough to make it unclear whether actual slavery or this modern practice had more devastating consequences.
- natives were often indifferent to othe prospect of amassing large amounts of wealth and engaging in the sort of consumer behavior that would create large markets for goods from the colonial centre. But the forces of international capital development was transforming these societies.
- Native chiefs effectively became salaried officials using native institutions for collection that undermine native political institution ad raised revenues. Shift from tradition yielded 'free labour’  meaning more labour existed to meet the needs of the large infrastructure projects being undertaken at the time
- the native was spoken for by the mandatory power
- in seeking to liberate the mandate peoples from the 'strenuous conditions of the modern world' the system instead entraps the mandate peoples within those conditions
- cycle whereby international institutions present themselves as a solution to the problem of they are an integral part.
- The transference of sovereignty to non-European peoples as undertaken by the Mandate system was simultaneous with, and indeed inseparable from the creation of new systems of subordination and control adminstered y internatinal institutions
